			| XTerm Configuration File |
			----------------------------

* What is this?
This is my configuration file for xterm, the standard x11 terminal emulator.

* Why is this?
I don't want to lose it.

* How do I use this?
You can copy Xresources to ~/.Xresources and load it with the command xrdb
~/.Xresources. You can also do a symbolic link from the Xresources file, to
~/.Xresources with the command ln -s xterm-config/Xresources ~/.Xresources
and load it the same way as before (xrdb ~/.Xresources).

* What makes this configuration file special?
+ It is mine.
+ It has Ctrl+Shift+c for copy and Ctrl+Shift+v for paste.
+ It has Ctrl++ for increasing the font size and Ctrl+- for decreasing it.
+ It uses a nice Monoespaced font.
+ The cursor blinks.
+ The bell is actually urgent.
